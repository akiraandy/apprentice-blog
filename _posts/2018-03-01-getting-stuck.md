So this week was pretty frustrating. I tried setting up my JavaScript testing environment using Jasmine, Karma, Webpack and Sinon. However, a lot of holes in my knowledge were revealed through this whole process and I had to spend a lot of time learning about how to make all these packages work together given my environment. This doesn't mean I didn't learn a lot! I learned A TON this week. But I feel a lot of stress because I didn't get to prepare for my talk as much as I wanted to and I didn't really read the book I was assigned this week. Getting all of that setup took me way longer than I anticipated but I really should've expected that, especially when I'm at the beginning of my journey. So despite learning a lot, the stories I had for this week didn't get done because of these unforeseen obstacles. You can also argue that all this should've been done at the beginning of my project and I think that is a fair point. It would have been difficult and time-consuming either way, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when.

One theme this week was "stuckness". I think we all get stuck, in programming and in life. How do we get ourselves unstuck? I'm not a sage but off the top of my head:

* Recognizing your stuckness
* Reaching out and ask others for help and/or advice
* Taking a break
* Move on to another task
* Zoom out

The first point is super important I think. There are moments (especially in programming) where you're knee deep in the problem and you think if you just keep cracking at it a bit longer you'll find the solution. This pattern of thinking continues until the cows come home and you've exhausted all your mental and emotional resources. There were several moments this week where I didn't recognize my stuckness for what it was. I think a great way to alert yourself is ***timeboxing***. Set a timer. If you haven't made any progress by the time that timer is up, move on to a different problem or just step away from the computer entirely. There's a chance you might do more damage than good if you keep banging your head against the problem. I found that a good nights rest works miracles and I find that coming back to the problem after rest brings progress faster and more effectively than any stubborn knocking will do.

My mentors were super helpful this week despite how lost I was. I made sure to reach out often when I was feeling stuck and they did their best to help. I also asked my apprentice peers for help and they were gracious enough to offer me advice. There's no shame in not knowing the answer. What's problematic is when not knowing the answer leads you to retreating out of a desire to protect your ego. The part of you that's embarrassed about not knowing all the answers? Let that go. It won't serve you. I feel very lucky to be working at company like 8th Light where asking questions is encouraged and no one will look down on you for revealing your ignorance.

The third and fifth point (taking a break and zooming out) kind of go hand in hand. When you're feeling overwhelmed, lost or confused. Try getting up from the computer, grabbing some water, going to the bathroom and maybe even catching a breath of fresh air outside. If you feel that even after taking a break you're not calm enough to tackle the same problem. Shift your focus, move on to another task.

I think that's where I really failed this week. I got so caught up in trying to understand and solve the problem that I didn't take the time to complete my other tasks. Banging my head against the problem for hours on end was doing me no good. I would have been way more productive had I used that time to instead read the book I was assigned, or work on my presentation. This is my biggest takeaway from this week. When I'm stuck for more than an hour, I'm going to move on to another task I have to complete for the week, no ifs ands or buts. I learned a lot this week and I'm going to take these lessons with me moving forward.
